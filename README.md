# Pose OSC Tracker

This is a real-time gesture and body landmark tracker using **MediaPipe Pose** and **OpenCV**, which streams selected joint coordinates via **OSC (Open Sound Control)** to a target application.

It is ideal for interactive installations, generative art, or motion-based control systems (e.g., TouchDesigner, Unity, Max/MSP).
